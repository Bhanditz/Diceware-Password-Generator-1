II. The Purpose of this Module
==============================

I made this module to help people choose better passwords. In reference to the famous xkcd comic on password strength, our society has..::

    "..successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess."

The reason this is true is because in choosing passwords, length is perhaps a more significant factor (as it generally produces more bits of entropy) than is obfuscated random symbols like '$' or '&'.

The comic is displayed below:
